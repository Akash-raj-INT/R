# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis in R

This project is a beginner-to-intermediate level **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** application in **R** that classifies movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**.

It uses basic NLP techniques (cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF) and implements two ML models: **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.

## 📌 Features

- Load sample or external movie review dataset
- Clean and preprocess review text (lowercase, punctuation, stemming, stopword removal)
- Convert text into TF-IDF features
- Train Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models
- Evaluate model performance (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall)
- Visualize word clouds for positive and negative reviews
- Predict sentiment for new reviews
- Export predictions to CSV

---

## 📁 Dataset

You can either:
- Use the default built-in sample dataset (18 labeled reviews), or
- Load your own dataset in `.csv` format with two columns:
  - `review` (text of the review)
  - `sentiment` (either `positive` or `negative`)
